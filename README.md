============

Application for managing personal expenses. 

Or rather - that's the intended function of the app, but it's purpose is to explore twig and jquery mobile, 
practice designing an MVC CRUD API and thinking about best practises when using jquery. I do this in my daily 
avarege 10 min of spare time.

Current staus
-------------
It is currently possible to register and make records. But not to review status, history or browse records. 
There is no error handling. There are no installation tools.

Roadmap
-------
I'm more or less developing along this trajectory: (italics are done)
- *API*
- *Basic Auth*
- *Add transaction procedure*
- Budget settings procedure
- Budget related cron jobs
- Records browser
- Basic Statistics viewer
- Score widget
- Delete records functionality
- Error handling
- External auth (like OAuth)
- Coolness
- A nice name
